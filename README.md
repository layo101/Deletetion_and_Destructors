# Deletion_and_Destructors
# When dynamic memory which has been allocated but is not longer used is not de-allocated, it cannot be re-used 
# When a progam does this, we call it a memory leak. 
# My task in this exercise was to fix a number of memory leaks. Some of these required fixing the implementation of a destructor.
